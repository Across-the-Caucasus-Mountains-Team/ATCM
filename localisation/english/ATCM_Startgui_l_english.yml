General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev continues his dual policy of 'perestroika' and 'glasnost', hoping to revitalize the country and reform socialism from within. Yet beneath the surface, the cracks are deepening. The economy is in severe decline. Empty shelves, inflation, falling industrial output, and widespread shortages have eroded public trust in the central government. Nationalist sentiments are on the rise: the Baltic republics have already declared moves toward independence, and unrest brews in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. Within the Communist Party, tensions grow between reformists who demand rapid democratization and conservatives who want to restore centralized authority. The Soviet Armed Forces remain formidable, but they suffer from low morale and budget cuts. The USSR’s nuclear arsenal remains the ultimate deterrent — but its future depends on maintaining unity and control over a fracturing system."

  country_info_startgui_che:0 "The Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic remains, on paper, a part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the USSR. But beneath the formal allegiance, a powerful nationalist movement is gaining momentum — calling for sovereignty, independence, and a complete break from Moscow. In the streets of Grozny, political rallies, underground clubs, and armed groups are growing bolder. Nationalist leaders, Afghan war veterans, disillusioned military officers, and Islamic figures are beginning to shape a new future for the region. The weakening of Soviet central power presents a rare — perhaps final — opportunity for secession. The local government walks a delicate line between obeying Soviet law and responding to mounting pressure for autonomy. At the same time, ethnic tensions between Chechens and Ingush, internal clan rivalries, and a severe lack of resources threaten to destabilize the republic from within. "
  country_info_startgui_sak:0 "The Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic enters 1991 on the edge of revolution. While still legally part of the Soviet Union, popular anger is boiling over. The brutal April 9th crackdown by Soviet troops in 1989, which killed peaceful protesters in Tbilisi, has forever severed the people's trust in Moscow. Nationalist sentiment is now mainstream. Under the leadership of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the independence movement is gaining speed, uniting intellectuals, students, and the broader public. Parliamentary elections are on the horizon, and many believe full secession is not only possible — but inevitable. Yet the path forward is full of danger. Ethnic tensions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia are growing rapidly, fueled by Soviet divide-and-rule tactics, local grievances, and the fear of Georgian nationalism. The risk of internal conflict and foreign intervention looms large."
