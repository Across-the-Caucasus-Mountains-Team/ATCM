 Across_the_Caucasus_DESC:0 "Dark times have started for the Soviet Union for every republic from the Baltics to the Caucasuses is collapsing. Gorbachev holds on to power but what can one man do when even his own people dont stand with him."
 SAK_Across_the_Caucasus_DESC:0 "Georgia is driving towards independence since 1990, Zviad Gamsakhurdia and the Soviet Union's mistakes played a key role in strengthening separatist sentiments. The Mountain State is now on the crossroads of its history and many paths lie before it. However, one thing remains certain, chaos is inevitable."
 RAS_Across_the_Caucasus_DESC:0 "The situation in the Caucasus is becoming increasingly dire, with ethnic tensions and calls for independence growing louder. The GKCHP is using this unrest to its advantage, positioning itself as the defender of the Soviet Union against separatist movements. Lord knows what will happen next, but one thing is certain: the Caucasus will be a battleground for the future of the Soviet Union."
 CHE_Across_the_Caucasus_DESC:0 "The Caucasus is a region of great strategic importance, and the Soviet Union is determined to maintain its influence there. However, the rise of Chechnya shows that the Soviet grip is weakening, and perhaps independence is inevitable. The GKCHP is determined to crush any separatist movements, but the situation is becoming increasingly volatile."
