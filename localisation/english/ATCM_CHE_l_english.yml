  chechnya.1.t:0 "Ingushetia separated from us"
  chechnya.1.d:0 "Despite shared history under the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, the Ingush leadership has officially rejected proposals to join the newly declared Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Citing a desire for stability, legal continuity, and growing tensions with the Chechen separatist movement, Ingushetia has declared its loyalty to the Russian Federation."
  chechnya.1.a:0 "Damn"
  chechnya.2.t:0 "Ingushetia remains part of our federation"
  chechnya.2.d:0 "While separatist sentiment grows in Chechnya and the region declares independence, Ingush leaders have officially announced their decision to remain part of the Russian Federation. Historically aligned with Moscow and concerned about territorial disputes with North Ossetia and instability in Chechnya, the Ingush see security and prosperity in remaining part of Russia."
  chechnya.2.a:0 "Good news"
  chechnya.3.t:0 "Current situation"
  chechnya.3.d:0 "By January 1, 1991, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, formally part of the RSFSR and the Soviet Union, had already practically escaped Moscow's control. The communist administration was rapidly losing its authority, mass nationalist rallies were paralyzing the work of the Supreme Soviet, and slogans about independence were becoming louder on the streets of Grozny. The streets were patrolled by armed activists, Afghan veterans, and clan militias. Unemployment was growing in the provinces, and there was a sense of impending anarchy. The Russian-speaking population was in a panic - the first threats and squatting were already appearing. The spirit of returned pride and inevitable conflict hung over the republic. Against the backdrop of the weakening center, a figure emerged - Air Force General Dzhokhar Dudayev, whose name was already being whispered with hope in markets and rallies. The collapse of the Soviet system in the region was a matter of time."
  chechnya.3.a:0 "Alright"
  chechnya.4.t:0 "INDEPENDENCE!"
  chechnya.4.d:0 "For centuries, our people have fought to preserve their identity, their faith, and their freedom. From the battles against Tsarist expansion to the bitter betrayal of 1944, we have endured occupation, exile, and silence. But now, in the chaos of a crumbling Soviet Union, history opens a narrow path forward one drenched in sacrifice, but lit by the fire of hope. \n Today, we break the chains that bound us to Moscow. The Chechen Republic declares itself sovereign and independent from all foreign rule. No longer will decisions about our destiny be made in far-off halls by those who neither speak our tongue nor understand our soul. This is not merely a political act, it is a resurrection. A rebirth of a nation buried but never forgotten. \n The road ahead will be hard. Enemies will call us rebels. Allies will hesitate. But the spirit of the Caucasus is not so easily extinguished."

Welcomed by President Dzhokhar Dudayev, Gamsakhurdia is seeking political asylum and support for his continued resistance against the new regime in Tbilisi."

  chechnya.6.t:0 "Russia attacks our"
  chechnya.6.d:0 "Early this morning, Russian forces crossed the border of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Airstrikes have begun on key targets in Grozny, and armored columns are advancing from Mozdok, Stavropol, and Dagestan. Moscow has declared a “constitutional restoration operation” against so-called illegal armed formations. President Dzhokhar Dudayev has ordered a general mobilization and called on the people to resist. War has begun. Chechnya must now survive against overwhelming odds."

  chechnya.11.d:0 "With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the declaration of the independent Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, a difficult issue has emerged: the fate of the large Russian-speaking population living in Grozny, Gudermes, and other urban centers. Many ethnic Russians now fear for their safety amid rising nationalist rhetoric and anti-Soviet sentiment. At the same time, radical voices within the new Chechen leadership are demanding "de-Sovietization" and the removal of what they call the remnants of Russian imperialism."

  chechnya.13.t:0 "Dzhokhar Dudayev is dead!"

  chechnya.14.t:0 "Russia staged an assassination attempt on Dudayev"
  chechnya.14.d:0 "Russian forces have conducted a precision missile strike on what they believed to be the location of President Dzhokhar Dudayev. However, the Chechen leader reportedly left the area minutes before impact. While several guards were killed and local infrastructure was damaged, Dudayev survived unscathed."
