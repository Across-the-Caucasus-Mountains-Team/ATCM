 Georgia.16.t:0 "Aftermath of Coup"
 Georgia.16.d:0 "The aftermath of the 1992 Georgian coup d'état plunged the newly independent republic into a period of profound instability, internal conflict, and national disillusionment. Following the violent overthrow of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia in January 1992 by the Military Council, composed of opposition militias and ex-Soviet officials, Georgia descended into lawlessness. Tbilisi became a city scarred by gunfights, power vacuums, and shattered authority. \n The Gamsakhurdia loyalists, known as Zviadists, waged an insurgency in western Georgia, particularly in Samegrelo, further destabilizing the region. Meanwhile, the national economy ground to a halt, infrastructure decayed, and law enforcement disintegrated into bribery and banditry. The promise of independence quickly curdled into a brutal reality of factionalism, ethnic violence, and failed governance. \n\n The 1992 coup's long shadow would haunt Georgia for the rest of the decade..."

On 21 December, Otar Litanishvili, a commander of the Mkhedrioni, brings a detailed map of the capital within the HQ and military leaders plan the coming attacks. Tengiz Kitovani takes command of the upcoming assault on Parliament, being the most knowledgeable of the building's infrastructure, from his time as head of the National Guard."

 Georgia.20.a:0 "damn... what about police?"
 Georgia.21.t:0 "The Police Situation"
 Georgia.21.d:0 "The aftermath of the Georgian Civil War has left the nation's police forces fractured, demoralized, and plagued with corruption. Once envisioned as guardians of public order, the Georgian police have instead become synonymous with extortion, violence, and political repression. \n In the early 1990s, amid the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia's law enforcement institutions disintegrated along with the state. Armed militias, political factions, and even organized crime filled the power vacuum. Many former officers either fled their posts or aligned themselves with paramilitary groups, often exploiting their positions for personal or political gain. \n By 1993, what remained of the Ministry of Internal Affairs was a shell of its Soviet-era structure. Officers were poorly trained, underpaid, and often resorted to bribes to survive. In regions like Samegrelo and Adjara, local warlords and governors exert more control over the police than the central government. \n Rebuilding the police is no small task. Trust must be re-established, Soviet-era tactics must be abandoned, and the deep-rooted influence of criminal networks must be uprooted. Georgia stands at a crossroads reform the police into a professional, accountable force or allow the rot to deepen and risk becoming a failed state."
 Georgia.21.a:0 "... what about mkhedrioni?"
 Georgia.22.t:0 "Mkhedrioni Situation"
 Georgia.22.d:0 "Once hailed by some as patriotic defenders of Georgia, the Mkhedrioni have now become a lawless force unto themselves — a paramilitary group that operates in the shadows, beyond the reach of the state. Formed in the chaos of independence and civil war, the Mkhedrioni originally presented themselves as nationalists loyal to the cause of Georgian unity. But in practice, they've grown into a criminal syndicate wielding more power than many government ministries. \n Led by the notorious Jaba Ioseliani, a warlord, bank robber, and self-proclaimed “knight” the Mkhedrioni played a decisive role in the 1992 ousting of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Their alliance with the military council and later Eduard Shevardnadze granted them political legitimacy… and impunity. \n Today, the Mkhedrioni act as kingmakers in Tbilisi, running rackets, intimidating political opponents, and openly clashing with rival factions. They are heavily armed, deeply entrenched, and increasingly defiant of any attempts to rein them in. Their presence in western Georgia is especially dominant often more visible than official security forces. \n The Georgian state faces a dangerous dilemma. To confront the Mkhedrioni risks open conflict and political instability. But tolerating them any longer undermines every effort at democratization, justice, and law. \n The question is no longer whether they are a threat, but whether we still have the strength to stop them."
 Georgia.22.a:0 "... Refugee situation?"
 Georgia.23.t:0 "Tetri artsivi Leaves the post in tskhinvali"
 Georgia.23.d:0 "Around 01:00, Gia Karkarashvili, who leads a militia of around 80 men known as Tetri Artsivi ("White Eagle"), leaves his post in Tskhinvali, where he is defending the Georgian neighborhoods of the city during the South Ossetian conflict, and sets up barricades on the main highway leading to Tbilisi from the north, in order to avoid any access to the capital, before leaving his soldiers in the outpost while bringing weapons to the opposition."
 Georgia.23.a:0 "huh"
 Georgia.24.t:0 "2 Government officials got kidnapped!"
 Georgia.24.d:0 "The morning of 22 December, according to the witness testimony of former deputy Sandro Bregadze, Sigua orders his personal guard, led by former Soviet secret service officer Murtaz Shaluahsvili, to position itself in Alexandrov Park (today known as the April 9 Park), in order to target the Parliament. With just the Kashveti Church serving as a buffer between both camps, government authorities send Mayor Tamaz Vashadze of Tbilisi and deputy Avtandil Rtskhiladze on a negotiation mission one last time before the beginning of the hostilities, but the two are kidnapped by Sigua's forces."
 Georgia.24.a:0 "What?! This can't be true! do they lost their mind?!"
 Georgia.25.t:0 "First Attack!"
 Georgia.25.d:0 "Around 07:30, Murtaz Shualashvili orders the first fire against Parliament and Karkarashvili launches four rockets on the Parliament building, inaugurating two weeks of violence. According to a New York Times report, the opposition refuses to accept any responsibility with the first attack. Throughout 22 December, both sides use rockets, grenades, and automatic weapons to fight each other. The Kashveti Church, which houses opposition soldiers, becomes a target of governmental forces. The Gamsakhurdia household, nicknamed "Colchis Bell", catches fire, but the family, under governmental protection during the coup, remains safe"
 Georgia.25.a:0 "Open the fire!"
 Georgia.26.t:0 "2 Officials betray!"

Kutateladze then takes a helicopter and is sent by Sigua and Tengiz Kitovani to Zugdidi, in western Georgia, to prevent the formation of pro-Gamsakhurdia forces. Tamaz Ninua, deputy Foreign Affairs Minister, also joins the opposition."
 Georgia.26.a:0 "Damn them!"
 Georgia.27.t:0 "Second attack and Fire in the Art Museum of Georgia"
 Georgia.27.d:0 "The second attack on 23 December results in a temporary victory of the presidential forces, but the Art Museum of Georgia, across the street from the Parliament, catches fire. The Russian press agency TASS writes about the event that several people are stuck inside the museum with no way out, while fire brigades have no access because of the opposition blockade on the street. Gamsakhurdia recalls the remaining parts of his National Guard in Tbilisi in order to attempt a breach through the opposition's barricades outside the city, thus putting an end to any large Georgian military presence in South Ossetia."
 Georgia.27.a:0 "..."
 Georgia.28.t:0 "Opposition forces enter in the Parliament"
 Georgia.28.d:0 "The most severe battle of the coup d'état takes place on 27 December when Tengiz Kitovani's troops penetrate inside the Parliament and put fire to the first floor of the building with gasoline."
 Georgia.28.a:0 "..."
 Georgia.29.t:0 "Jaba is free"
 Georgia.29.d:0 "On 28 December, it becomes clear that government forces have lost all control outside of the presidential bunker and Tengiz Kitovani, followed by a Mkhedrioni detachment, captures the former Soviet office of the KGB in the Gldani neighborhood, where several opposition leaders are imprisoned. Eight prisoners are freed and brought to Rustaveli Avenue to encourage fighters, including Giorgi Chanturia, Giorgi Khaindrava, and the titular head of the Mkhedrioni, Jaba Ioseliani. The latter takes back his control over the militia and Chanturia announces that the civil war must continue until the resignation of Gamsakhurdia. On their way, the Kitovani troops burn down several buildings of strategic importance, including the National Bank of Georgia and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, leading to the destruction of nearly 210,000 documents (or 80% of the entirety) of governmental archives from the Soviet era."
 Georgia.29.a:0 "..."
 Georgia.30.t:0 "Deputy of minister of defence betrayed us!"
 Georgia.30.d:0 "On 31 December, Nodar Giorgadze, deputy Minister of Defense and leader of a militia made up of veterans from the Afghanistan War, publicly asks for Gamsakhurdia's resignation, leading to his arrest."
 Georgia.30.a:0 "Damn him!"
 Georgia.31.t:0 "Events outside of Tbilisi"
 Georgia.31.d:0 "While Tbilisi falls into chaos, the rest of Georgia (except for South Ossetia) remains more or less calm during the first week of the conflict. However, the events affected some rural zones in January 1992. Thus, while Georgian television falls under opposition control on 1 January, all programming is stopped in western Georgia, which had remained loyal to Gamsakhurdia, thanks to the capture of the broadcasting tower of Kutaisi by Zviadists. In the same manner, while a majority of the country stops receiving newspapers following the closure of printers in Tbilisi during the coup, western Georgia keeps its pro-Gamsakhurdia newspapers thanks to the printers of Kutaisi. \n On 4 January, Zviad Gamsakhurdia signs a decree from his bunker requiring all municipal and regional governments outside of Tbilisi to organize a large-scale mobilization of troops against the opposition, an act described by some as a call for guerrilla warfare. This order requires the mobilization to take place until 7 January and mandates the local governments to open mobilization centers to welcome all military conscripts, aged 20 to 45 years old. Local authorities are also under the obligation to organize transport for this theoretical army. However, without a National Guard, this decree cannot be enforced. \n In response, the Military Council announces the abolition of local governments and declares its intent to appoint local governors loyal to the opposition. According to an announcement by the Council, the majority of local government centers fell into the junta's control by 18:30 on 4 January. However, the country still includes some cities loyal to the President; a gun battle takes place at the Rustavi City Hall, 25 kilometers south of the capital, between the local government and Military Council troops, on 5 January. No injury is reported from this battle."
 Georgia.31.a:0 "at least partial victory"
 Georgia.32.t:0 "Repressing Demonstrations"
 Georgia.32.d:0 "While the Military Council issued a new decree forbidding all protestations, an assembly of 3,000 to 4,000 Gamsakhurdia supporters organize a demonstration around 12:00 on 3 January, starting from a railway station several miles from the battlefield. The protesters, including mainly middle-aged men and women, carry the President's portrait, while chanting his name ("Zviadi!") and walking toward Rustaveli Avenue. After just 15 minutes, a car transporting masked men of the Mkhedrioni throws smoke bombs on the crowd, which only angers and energizes it, while encouraging applause from civilians on their balconies. But a group of eight to ten masked men wearing sunglasses to hide their identities, form a line in front of the demonstrators and start shooting blanks to disperse the crowd. A few instants later, real bullets are fired at the protesters, who disperse violently while some take refuge behind cars. Two protesters are immediately killed and several are injured, including two more who would die a few days later."
 Georgia.32.a:0 "Damn them!"
 Georgia.33.t:0 "President Left the Parliament"
 Georgia.33.d:0 "On the morning of 6 January, around 05:00,[101] Zviad Gamsakhurdia, his family, and a personal guard of 60 dignitaries and bodyguards leave the Parliament through the road behind the building, the only way out left open by opposition troops in order to control the presidential escape and prevent a dispersion of armed Gamsakhurdia supporters across the capital. The President and his family leave in the presidential car, a Mercedes-Benz, and, followed by an all-terrain vehicle, a minibus, and two Zhigulis, escape a roadblock installed along the Mtkvari river by Giorgi Shengelia, Vakhtang Kikabadze, and Giorgi Khaindrava. Opposition forces penetrate then into the abandoned and ruined Parliament, some supporting columns of which are entirely destroyed, proclaiming victory against the Gamsakhurdia government and freeing the 40 prisoners left in the bunker."

After months of political paralysis and rising tensions, Yeltsin dissolved the Supreme Soviet, a move denounced as unconstitutional by his opponents, who in turn declared his presidency illegitimate and barricaded themselves inside the White House (Russian parliament building). \n On October 3rd and 4th, the standoff exploded into violence. Armed supporters of the parliament clashed with loyalist security forces, storming the Mayor's Office and attempting to seize the national television center. In response, Yeltsin ordered a military assault. Tanks opened fire on the White House, shelling the heart of Russian democracy as the world watched in shock. \n By evening, the rebellion was crushed. Dozens lay dead, hundreds were wounded, and the era of hopeful post-Soviet reform was stained with blood. Yeltsin emerged victorious—but at a terrible cost. Russia's new constitution would centralize vast power in the presidency, and the events of Black October would cast a long shadow over the country's democratic future."

The military was urged not to take part in the coup, and local authorities were asked to follow laws from the RSFSR President rather than the GKChP. Although he initially avoided the measure to avoid sparking a civil war, Yeltsin also subsequently took command of all Soviet military and security forces in the RSFSR.

Outside, Eduard Shevardnadze, Mstislav Rostropovich, and Yelena Bonner delivered speeches in support of Yeltsin. \n In the afternoon, Kryuchkov, Yazov and Pugo finally decided to attack the White House.

Kryuchkov's and Yazov's deputies, KGB general Gennady Ageyev and Army general Vladislav Achalov, planned the assault, codenamed "Operation Grom" (Thunder), which would gather elements of the Alpha Group and Vympel elite special forces units, supported by paratroopers, Moscow OMON, Internal Troops of the ODON, three tank companies and a helicopter squadron. Alpha Group commander General Viktor Karpukhin and other senior unit officers, together with Airborne deputy commander Gen. Alexander Lebed mingled with the crowds near the White House and assessed the possibility of such an operation. Afterwards, Karpukhin and Vympel commander Colonel Boris Beskov tried to convince Ageyev that the operation would result in bloodshed and should be cancelled.

According to journalist and democracy campaigner Sergey Parkhomenko, who was in the crowd defending the White House, 'those deaths played a crucial role, both sides were so horrified that it brought a halt to everything.'
